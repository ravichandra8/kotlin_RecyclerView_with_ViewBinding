# kotlin_RecyclerView_with_ViewBinding

1) RecyclerView with two different times ie., header item and footer item.
2) Using View Binding to set the data to UI. (ViewBinding is replacement of findViewByID)

advantage of viewBinding:
1) type-safe
2) null-safe
3) only reference id of current layout
4) support kotlin and java
5) less amount of code written.
